### Hi there 👋

Welcome! I'm Fabiane Queiroz.

Here is a short(?) bio 😅	:

I received a Bachelor's in Computer Science from the Computer Institute at the Federal University of Alagoas - Brazil 💾.  I did a master's degree 🤓	 (Computer Graphics) at the Informatics Center at the Federal University of Pernambuco - Brazil. I did my doctorate 🤓🤓	 (Image Processing and Computer Vision) at the same University. I worked with Procedural Texture Synthesis in a 3D domain during my MSc. I focused on studying and developing a biological model for animal white spotting coat pattern generation 🐼🐼. In my doctorate, I worked with Medical Image Restoration 🏥. 

Currently 🔭, I'm a Research/Professor at Universidade Federal of Alagoas 📫. I teach my students about Algorithms, Data Structures and Object Orientation, Differential Calculus, Numerical Analysis, Signal and System Analysis, and Image Analysis. Yes, I know, it is too much!! Being a professor in Brazil hurts ⚡! My research interests 🤔🌱👯❤️ include Medical Image Processing, Medical Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision.
